# StockPricePredictor
<p>My interst in Quantitative Finance led me to mkaing a stock price predictor using two Machine Learning Models:
    <ul>1. Random Forest Model -> random_forest_model.ipynb</ul>
    <ul>2. Recurren Neural Network -> rnn.ipynb</ul>

<p>The project utilizes live data from the Yahoo Finance Python library: yfinance. Other libraries used during the project include Pandas, Numpy, sklearn, matplotlib and Tensorflow.</p>
